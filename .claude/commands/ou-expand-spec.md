# Expand Ouroboros Spec

Transforms a basic spec template into a detailed, validated, execution-ready specification.

## Usage

```bash
/expand-spec {feature-name}
/expand-spec {feature-name} --interactive
/expand-spec {feature-name} --auto
/expand-spec {feature-name} --validate-only
```

## Modes

### Interactive Mode (Default)
Asks targeted questions based on detected pattern to flesh out requirements, design, and tasks.

### Automated Mode (--auto)
Uses pattern defaults and minimal input for rapid expansion.

### Validate Only (--validate-only)
Runs pre-flight validation without making changes.

---

## Process

### Phase 1: Load & Analyze (Sequential üêå)

**1.1 Load Spec Files**
- Read `ouroboros/specs/{feature-name}/requirements.md`
- Read `ouroboros/specs/{feature-name}/design.md`
- Read `ouroboros/specs/{feature-name}/tasks.md`
- Extract current state and placeholders

**1.2 Detect Pattern**
- Use Pattern Recognizer (`ouroboros/intelligence/pattern-recognizer.md`)
- Analyze keywords, structure, and components
- Identify primary pattern and confidence score
- Detect secondary patterns if applicable

**1.3 Display Analysis**
```
üîç Spec Analysis: {feature-name}

Pattern Detected: {Pattern Name} ({confidence}% confidence)
Current State:
  - Requirements: {X} defined, {Y} placeholders remaining
  - Design: {X} sections complete, {Y} need details
  - Tasks: {X} phases, {Y} tasks defined

Recommendations:
  - {Recommendation 1}
  - {Recommendation 2}
```

---

### Phase 2: Interactive Expansion (If interactive mode)

**2.1 Requirements Expansion**

Ask pattern-specific questions to expand requirements:

   3. JWT tokens
   4. OAuth 2.0
   5. Session-based

Q5: Do resources have lifecycle states?
   1. Yes (draft, published, archived, etc.)
   2. No (simple active/deleted)
   3. Not applicable
```

**For Creative Iterative Pattern:**
```

   2. No, single path refinement
```

**For Structured Sequential Pattern:**
```
Q1: How many main stages/phases are in your workflow?
   (Number of sequential stages)

Q2: What validation happens between stages?
   1. Automated tests
   2. Manual review
   3. Quality gates

   1. Report with recommendations
   2. Decision matrix
   3. Technical findings
   4. Proof of concept
```

**2.2 Design Expansion**

Based on requirements answers, generate specific design sections:

- Fill in technology choices
- Expand component descriptions
- Add architecture diagrams (in markdown/mermaid)
- Define data models
- Specify APIs/interfaces
- Document decision rationale

**2.3 Tasks Expansion**

Transform generic tasks into specific, actionable items:

**Example transformation:**
```markdown
BEFORE:
- [ ] **üêå 1.1 Implement core API/functionality**

AFTER (for Quartz blog):
- [ ] **üêå 1.1 Setup Quartz 4 project structure**
  - Clone Quartz 4 template repository
  - Configure quartz.config.ts with site metadata
  - Setup content folder structure (posts/, pages/, assets/)
  - Test local build with `npx quartz build --serve`
  - _Context: ~8K tokens_
  - _Duration: ~15 minutes_
```

Add context estimates and duration for each task:
- **Context budget**: Estimated tokens needed for task execution
- **Duration**: Estimated time to complete
- **Dependencies**: Explicit task dependencies
- **File scope**: Which files will be modified

---

### Phase 3: Automated Expansion (If --auto mode)

**3.1 Use Pattern Defaults**

Apply sensible defaults based on detected pattern without asking questions:

**For Modern Dev Workflow:**
- Deployment: Docker Compose (self-hosted)
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- IaC: Docker Compose
- Monitoring: Basic (logs + uptime)
- Domain: Placeholder for user's domain

**For Resource Management:**
- Storage: File-based or PostgreSQL
- Auth: JWT tokens
- CRUD: Full CRUD for all resources
- Lifecycle: Simple active/inactive

**3.2 Fill Templates Intelligently**

Use feature name and pattern to infer reasonable values:
- Parse feature name for hints (e.g., "quartz-blog" ‚Üí blogging platform)
- Use common tech stacks for pattern
- Add TODO comments for critical decisions
- Flag items requiring user input with `[USER_INPUT_REQUIRED]`

---

### Phase 4: Generate Supporting Files (Parallel üêç)

**4.1 Generate Auto-Skill**

Create `.claude/skills/{feature-name}.md` with:
- Project overview
- Pattern type
- Key requirements summary
- Architecture approach
- Task phase summary
- Context-efficient format (saves 200-750K tokens)

**Example auto-skill:**
```markdown
---
name: quartz-blog-site
description: Self-hosted Quartz 4 blog with automated deployment
pattern: modern-dev-workflow
---

# Quartz Blog Site

```

Each phase directory ready to receive:
- `summary-{task-id}.md` - Task execution summaries
- `consolidated.md` - Cross-task insights
- `artifacts/` - Generated files, configs, etc.

**4.3 Generate Validation Checklist**

Create `ouroboros/specs/{feature-name}/validation-checklist.md`:
```markdown
