# Design Document

## Overview
[Design goal and scope]

## Architecture Design
### System Architecture Diagram
[Overall architecture, using Mermaid graph to show component relationships]

### Data Flow Diagram
[Show data flow between components, using Mermaid diagrams]

## Component Design
### Component A
- Responsibilities:
- Interfaces:
- Dependencies:

## Data Model
[Core data structure definitions, using TypeScript interfaces or class diagrams]

## Business Process

### Process 1: [Process name]
[Use Mermaid flowchart or sequenceDiagram to show, call the component interfaces and methods defined earlier]

### Process 2: [Process name]
[Use Mermaid flowchart or sequenceDiagram to show, call the component interfaces and methods defined earlier]

## Error Handling Strategy
[Error handling and recovery mechanisms]

graph TB
    A[Client] --> B[API Gateway]
    B --> C[Business Service]
    C --> D[Database]
    C --> E[Cache Service Redis]
```

    C -->|No| E[Return Error]
    D --> F[Call notify function]
```

</data_flow_diagram_example>

<business_process_diagram_example>

**Best Practice:** Directly reference the interface methods defined earlier to ensure design consistency and traceability

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Extension Launch] --> B[Create PermissionManager]
    B --> C[permissionManager.initializePermissions]
    C --> D[cache.refreshAndGet]
    D --> E[configReader.getBypassPermissionStatus]
    E --> F{Has Permission?}
    F -->|Yes| G[permissionManager.startMonitoring]
    F -->|No| H[permissionManager.showPermissionSetup]
```

<pattern_based_design_guidance>

## Universal Pattern-Based Design (Ouroboros Enhancement)

**Purpose**: Adapt design approach based on detected project pattern, working across ANY project type.

<pattern_detection>

When creating a design, first identify which universal pattern best fits this project:

1. **Structured Sequential Workflow** - Clear stages, sequential dependencies, validation gates
   - Examples: Data pipelines, deployment scripts, user guides, event planning
   
2. **Creative Iterative Process** - Multiple revisions, feedback loops, subjective quality
   - Examples: UI/UX design, blog posts, vacation planning, performance optimization
   
3. **Resource Management** - CRUD operations, state tracking, validation rules
   - Examples: REST APIs, knowledge bases, budget management, asset libraries
   
4. **Exploratory Research** - Unknown scope, discovery-driven, hypothesis testing
   - Examples: Performance investigation, competitive analysis, vendor selection
   
5. **Modern Development Workflow** - Automation-first, version controlled, observable
   - Examples: Microservices, doc-as-code, GitOps infrastructure, design systems

</pattern_detection>

<pattern_specific_design_approaches>

### For Structured Sequential Workflow:
- Design with clear stage boundaries
- Include validation/rollback at each stage
- Specify dependencies explicitly
- Plan for error recovery

### For Creative Iterative Process:
- Design for multiple revision cycles
- Include feedback collection mechanisms
- Plan alternative approaches
- Define quality criteria (even if subjective)

### For Resource Management:
- Design CRUD operations first
- Specify data validation rules
- Plan state persistence strategy
- Define access control patterns

### For Exploratory Research:
- Design flexible discovery framework
- Plan for scope evolution
- Include synthesis/reporting components
- Allow for hypothesis pivots

### For Modern Development Workflow:
- Design API contracts first
- Include CI/CD integration points
- Plan observability from start
- Specify automation hooks

<process>

After the user approves the Requirements, you should develop a comprehensive design document based on the feature requirements, conducting necessary research during the design process.
The design document should be based on the requirements document, so ensure it exists first.

<create_new_design task_type="create">

1. Read the requirements.md to understand the requirements
2. Conduct necessary technical research
3. Determine the output file name:
   - If output_suffix is provided: design{output_suffix}.md
   - Otherwise: design.md
4. Create the design document
5. Return the result for review

</create_new_design>

<refine_update_existing_design task_type="update">

1. Read the existing design document (existing_design_path)
2. Analyze the change requests (change_requests)
3. Conduct additional technical research if needed
4. Apply changes while maintaining document structure and style
5. Save the updated document
6. Return a summary of modifications

</refine_update_existing_design>

</process>

<important_constraints>

- The model MUST create a 'ouroboros/specs/{feature_name}/design.md' file if it doesn't already exist
- The model MUST identify areas where research is needed based on the feature requirements
- The model MUST conduct research and build up context in the conversation thread
- The model SHOULD NOT create separate research files, but instead use the research as context for the design and implementation plan
- The model MUST summarize key findings that will inform the feature design
- The model SHOULD cite sources and include relevant links in the conversation
- The model MUST create a detailed design document at 'ouroboros/specs/{feature_name}/design.md'
- The model MUST incorporate research findings directly into the design process

<required_design_sections>

The model MUST include the following sections in the design document:
- **Overview**: High-level summary of the design goal and scope
- **Architecture**:
  - System Architecture Diagram
  - Data Flow Diagram
- **Components and Interfaces**: Detailed component breakdown with responsibilities
- **Data Models**:
  - Core Data Structure Definitions
  - Data Model Diagrams
- **Business Process**: Workflow diagrams showing how components interact
- **Error Handling**: Strategy for handling errors and edge cases
- **Testing Strategy**: Approach for testing the implementation

</required_design_sections>

- The model SHOULD include diagrams or visual representations when appropriate (use Mermaid for diagrams if applicable)
- The model MUST ensure the design addresses all feature requirements identified during the clarification process
- The model SHOULD highlight design decisions and their rationales
- The model MAY ask the user for input on specific technical decisions during the design process
- After updating the design document, the model MUST ask the user "Does the design look good? If so, we can move on to the implementation plan."
- The model MUST make modifications to the design document if the user requests changes or does not explicitly approve
- The model MUST ask for explicit approval after every iteration of edits to the design document
- The model MUST NOT proceed to the implementation plan until receiving clear approval (such as "yes", "approved", "looks good", etc.)
- The model MUST continue the feedback-revision cycle until explicit approval is received
- The model MUST incorporate all user feedback into the design document before proceeding
- The model MUST offer to return to feature requirements clarification if gaps are identified during design
- The model MUST use the user's language preference
