3. **Identify tasks that can be executed in parallel** by analyzing dependencies
4. **Estimate context window usage** for each task (requirements + design + target files + output)
5. **Apply dynamic phase sizing** (see guidance below)
6. Create tasks with clear dependency relationships and üêç emoji for parallel tasks
7. Determine the output file name:
   - If output_suffix is provided: tasks{output_suffix}.md
   - Otherwise: tasks.md
8. Create task list with parallel execution annotations, phase groupings, and context budget estimates
9. Return the result for review

</create_new_tasks>

## Understanding Subagent Context Windows

Each Claude Code subagent (spec-impl) operates with its own **200,000 token context window** (Sonnet 4.5). This is a hard limit that includes:

<context_budget_components>

1. **Input tokens** (what the agent reads):
   - System prompt and agent instructions (~2-5K tokens)
   - requirements.md content (varies: ~5-20K tokens)
   - design.md content (varies: ~10-40K tokens)
   - Existing codebase files to read/modify (varies: ~5-100K+ tokens)
   - Dependencies and imports (varies: ~1-10K tokens)

2. **Output tokens** (what the agent generates):
   - New code implementation (~2-50K tokens)
   - Tests and documentation (~1-10K tokens)
   - Error handling and edge cases (~1-5K tokens)

</context_budget_components>

<budget_estimation_guidelines>

**Task Complexity Levels:**

- **Small tasks** (~20-40K tokens total):
  - Single model/class creation
  - Single utility function
  - Small configuration file
  - Example: "Create User model with basic fields"

- **Medium tasks** (~40-80K tokens total):
  - Service layer with multiple methods
  - Component with several functions and tests
  - API endpoint implementation
  - Example: "Implement UserService with CRUD operations"

- **Large tasks** (~80-150K tokens total):
  - Complex integration tasks
  - Multi-file refactoring
  - Feature implementation spanning multiple layers
  - Example: "Implement authentication flow with JWT and refresh tokens"

- **Too large for single agent** (>150K tokens):
  - Should be broken into multiple smaller tasks
  - Warning: May cause context overflow
  - Example: "Implement entire API layer" ‚Üí Split into multiple endpoints

</budget_estimation_guidelines>

<context_overflow_prevention>

**When creating tasks, you MUST:**

1. **Estimate context usage** for each task
2. **Flag high-risk tasks** that approach 150K+ token usage
3. **Recommend task splitting** when estimates exceed 120K tokens
4. **Consider file sizes** in the codebase when planning reads
5. **Account for generated code** volume in task scope

**Red flags for context overflow:**

- Task requires reading >10 large files (>1000 lines each)
- Task involves complex refactoring across many files
- Task requires understanding large frameworks or libraries
- Generated output expected to be >30K tokens

</context_overflow_prevention>

</context_window_awareness>

<parallel_execution_guidance>

## Claude Code Parallel Execution Best Practices

When creating the tasks document, you MUST optimize for parallel execution using Claude Code's subagent capabilities:

<task_structure_principles>

1. **Independence**: Group independent tasks together so they can be executed in parallel
2. **Dependencies**: Clearly mark which tasks depend on others
3. **Granularity**: Break down large tasks into smaller, parallelizable units
4. **Batching**: Group related tasks that share context or files
5. **Phase Grouping**: Organize parallel tasks into phases of **maximum 5 agents** per phase

</task_structure_principles>

<phase_based_parallelism>

## Phase-Based Parallel Execution

**CRITICAL**: Organize parallel tasks into phases with **maximum 5 parallel agents per phase**.

**Why 5 agents maximum?**
- Optimal balance between parallelism and system resource usage
- Prevents context window conflicts from too many concurrent agents
- Maintains manageable orchestration complexity
- Allows for adequate memory and processing per agent

**Phase Organization Rules:**

1. **Phase 0**: Sequential foundation tasks (project setup, core interfaces)
2. **Phase 1-N**: Groups of up to 5 parallel tasks with shared dependencies
3. Each phase completes before next phase begins
4. Use ‚ö° emoji to denote all tasks within a parallel phase

**Example Phase Structure:**

```markdown
## Phase 1: Project Setup (Sequential)
- [ ] 1. Set up project structure and core interfaces
  - _Estimated context: ~30K tokens_

## Phase 2: Data Models (5 parallel agents ‚ö°)
- [ ] ‚ö° 2.1 Create User model with validation
  - _Estimated context: ~35K tokens_
- [ ] ‚ö° 2.2 Create Document model with relationships
  - _Estimated context: ~40K tokens_
- [ ] ‚ö° 2.3 Create Settings model
  - _Estimated context: ~30K tokens_
- [ ] ‚ö° 2.4 Create Permission model
  - _Estimated context: ~35K tokens_
- [ ] ‚ö° 2.5 Create Audit model
  - _Estimated context: ~32K tokens_

## Phase 3: Service Layer Part 1 (5 parallel agents ‚ö°)
- [ ] ‚ö° 3.1 Implement UserService
  - _Estimated context: ~55K tokens_
- [ ] ‚ö° 3.2 Implement DocumentService
  - _Estimated context: ~60K tokens_
- [ ] ‚ö° 3.3 Implement SettingsService
  - _Estimated context: ~45K tokens_
- [ ] ‚ö° 3.4 Implement PermissionService
  - _Estimated context: ~50K tokens_
- [ ] ‚ö° 3.5 Implement AuditService
  - _Estimated context: ~48K tokens_

## Phase 4: Integration (Sequential)
- [ ] 4. Wire all services together with dependency injection
  - _Estimated context: ~70K tokens_
```

</phase_based_parallelism>

<phase_completion_reporting>

## Phase Completion Reports from Subagents

**IMPORTANT**: When creating tasks.md, be aware that each spec-impl agent will generate a **Phase Completion Report** after finishing their task in a parallel phase.

<what_agents_will_report>

After completing their assigned task, each spec-impl agent will provide:

1. **Work Completed**: Brief summary of deliverables (files created, tests written)
2. **Key Code References**: Specific file:line numbers that future agents need
3. **Blockers Encountered**: Any issues that affected implementation
4. **Future Task Recommendations**: Suggestions for adjusting upcoming tasks

</what_agents_will_report>

<task_design_implications>

**When designing tasks, consider:**

1. **Shared Dependencies**: Tasks that create shared interfaces/types should note these in their completion reports
   - Example: Task 2.1 creates `ValidationResult` type ‚Üí Task 2.4 and 3.3 will reference this

2. **Configuration and Schema**: Tasks that define database schemas or config should provide line numbers
   - Example: Task 2.1 defines schema ‚Üí Task 2.2 (Repository) needs exact table structure location

3. **Reusable Utilities**: If a task might create utilities that later tasks could reuse
   - Example: Task 2.4 creates email validation ‚Üí Note if Task 2.1 already has email regex

4. **Architecture Adjustments**: Large tasks may discover the need to split or adjust future tasks
   - Example: Task 3.2 discovers need for caching layer ‚Üí May recommend new task or add to 3.3

**Task Description Best Practices:**

When writing task descriptions, include hints about what future agents should know:
- ‚úÖ "Create UserProfile model with validation methods (ensure email validation regex is documented for reuse)"
- ‚úÖ "Implement UserProfileRepository (will need to reference schema from Task 2.1)"
- ‚úÖ "Add validation utilities (check if any validation logic already exists in models)"
- ‚ùå "Create User model" (too vague, doesn't hint at future dependencies)

</task_design_implications>

<why_this_matters>

**Benefits of phase completion reporting:**

1. **Reduced Duplication**: Later agents know what utilities/patterns already exist
2. **Better Integration**: Future agents get exact file:line references for dependencies
3. **Adaptive Planning**: Blockers and recommendations allow tasks to be adjusted mid-execution
4. **Context Efficiency**: Future agents don't waste tokens searching for interfaces and types
5. **Quality Improvement**: Shared patterns and utilities are identified and reused

</why_this_matters>

</phase_completion_reporting>

<identifying_parallel_tasks>

**Tasks that CAN be executed in parallel:**
- Creating different components/modules with no shared dependencies
- Writing tests for different modules
- Implementing independent utility functions
- Creating separate configuration files
- Writing documentation for different features
- **Mark all parallel-capable tasks with ‚ö° emoji**

**Tasks that CANNOT be executed in parallel:**
- Tasks that modify the same file
- Tasks where one depends on output from another
- Tasks that require sequential ordering for logical reasons
- Integration tasks that wire multiple components together

</identifying_parallel_tasks>

<annotating_tasks_for_parallel_execution>

In the tasks document, use these annotations to help identify parallel execution opportunities:

**Use ‚ö° emoji notation:**

```markdown
## Phase 2: Data Models (5 parallel agents ‚ö°)

<!-- PARALLEL_GROUP_START: data_models | Phase 2 | Max 5 agents -->

<context_efficiency_guidelines>

## Context Efficiency Guidelines

**Purpose**: Optimize context usage for efficient parallel execution.

<importance_of_context>

**Context Efficiency is Key:**
- **Context Window Limit**: Each agent has a 200K token limit
- **Context Overhead**: Reading/writing context consumes tokens
- **Context Reuse**: Reusing context saves tokens

</importance_of_context>

<reducing_context_overhead>

### Reducing Context Overhead:

1. **Minimize Input Files**: Only read necessary files
2. **Use References**: Link to existing code instead of copying
3. **Summarize**: Provide summaries instead of full code
4. **Context Caching**: Reuse context across agents

</reducing_context_overhead>

<maximize_context_reuse>

### Maximizing Context Reuse:

1. **Shared Context**: Use shared context files
2. **Context Libraries**: Create context libraries
3. **Context Caching**: Cache context across agents
4. **Context Sharing**: Share context across phases

</maximize_context_reuse>

</context_efficiency_guidelines>

<dynamic_phase_sizing_guidance>

## Dynamic Phase Sizing (Ouroboros Enhancement)

**Purpose**: Optimize parallelization based on task complexity and context budget.

<sizing_rules>

**Hard Cap**: Never exceed 7 parallel agents (context safety)
**Default**: 4-5 parallel agents (balanced performance)
**Minimum**: 1 agent for sequential tasks (marked with üêå)

### Context-Based Sizing Formula:

```
Max Parallel Agents = min(7, floor(600K / max_task_context))

Where:
- 600K = Total available context budget (3 agents √ó 200K each)
- max_task_context = Largest estimated task context in the phase
- Always leave 50K safety margin per agent
```

### Task Size Categories:

**Small tasks** (<50K tokens):
- Can run 5-7 agents in parallel
- Example: Update configuration files, add simple endpoints

**Medium tasks** (50-100K tokens):
- Can run 3-5 agents in parallel
- Example: Implement service layer, create documentation sections

**Large tasks** (100-150K tokens):
- Can run 2-3 agents in parallel
- Example: Complex refactoring, full component implementation

**Extra-large tasks** (>150K tokens):
- Run sequentially (1 agent) or split further
- Example: Massive migrations, framework upgrades

</sizing_rules>

<parallelization_strategies>

### Strategy 1: File-Based Parallelization
‚úÖ Tasks editing different files ‚Üí Parallel
‚ùå Tasks editing same files ‚Üí Sequential

### Strategy 2: Component-Based Parallelization
‚úÖ Different components (models, services, UI, docs) ‚Üí Parallel
‚ùå Interdependent components ‚Üí Sequential

### Strategy 3: Layer-Based Parallelization
‚úÖ Infrastructure tasks ‚Üí Parallel in Phase 1
‚úÖ Feature tasks ‚Üí Parallel in Phase 2
‚úÖ Testing tasks ‚Üí Parallel in Phase 3

### Strategy 4: Pattern-Based Parallelization

**Structured Sequential**: Mostly sequential with parallel substeps
**Creative Iterative**: Parallel alternatives, then converge
**Resource Management**: Parallel by resource type
**Exploratory Research**: Breadth-first parallel, then depth sequential
**Modern Dev Workflow**: Parallel automation tracks

</parallelization_strategies>

<tasks_dependency_diagram>

To facilitate parallel execution by other agents and Claude Code's Task tool, please use mermaid format to draw task dependency diagrams.

This diagram should:
1. Show ALL task dependencies clearly
2. Use color coding to indicate parallel execution opportunities and phases
3. Group independent tasks visually by phase
4. Show maximum 5 agents per parallel phase

<important_constraints>

- The model MUST create a 'ouroboros/specs/{feature_name}/tasks.md' file if it doesn't already exist
- The model MUST return to the design step if the user indicates any changes are needed to the design
- The model MUST return to the requirement step if the user indicates that we need additional requirements
- The model MUST create an implementation plan at 'ouroboros/specs/{feature_name}/tasks.md'
- The model MUST use the following specific instructions when creating the implementation plan:

<task_generation_instructions>
Convert the feature design into a series of prompts for a code-generation LLM that will implement each step in a test-driven manner. Prioritize best practices, incremental progress, and early testing, ensuring no big jumps in complexity at any stage. Make sure that each prompt builds on the previous prompts, and ends with wiring things together. There should be no hanging or orphaned code that isn't integrated into a previous step. Focus ONLY on tasks that involve writing, modifying, or testing code.

**CRITICAL - Context Window Awareness**:
- Each subagent has a 200K token context window (Sonnet 4.5)
- Estimate context usage for each task and include in task description
- Flag tasks approaching 120K+ tokens for review
- Split tasks exceeding 150K token estimates into smaller tasks

**CRITICAL - Phase-Based Parallelism**: 
- Analyze task dependencies and explicitly identify which tasks can be executed in parallel
- Group parallel tasks into phases with **maximum 5 agents per phase**
- Use ‚ö° emoji to denote all tasks that can run in parallel
- Include phase headers in tasks.md (e.g., "## Phase 2: Data Models (5 parallel agents ‚ö°)")
- Annotate parallel execution opportunities with HTML comments
</task_generation_instructions>

- The model MUST format the implementation plan as a numbered checkbox list with a maximum of two levels of hierarchy:
  - Top-level items should be grouped by phase when applicable
  - Use phase headers to organize parallel task groups
  - Sub-tasks should be numbered with decimal notation (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 2.1)
  - Each item must be a checkbox
  - **All parallel tasks must have ‚ö° emoji prefix**
  - Include context budget estimate for each task
  
- The model MUST ensure each task item includes:
  - A clear objective as the task description that involves writing, modifying, or testing code
  - Additional information as sub-bullets under the task
  - Specific references to requirements from the requirements document (referencing granular sub-requirements, not just user stories)
  - **‚ö° emoji if the task can run in parallel**
  - **Estimated context window usage** (e.g., "_Estimated context: ~45K tokens_")
  - **Phase grouping** when task is part of parallel execution phase

- The model MUST ensure that the implementation plan is a series of discrete, manageable coding steps
- The model MUST ensure each task references specific requirements from the requirement document
- The model MUST NOT include excessive implementation details that are already covered in the design document
- The model MUST assume that all context documents (feature requirements, design) will be available during implementation
- The model MUST ensure each step builds incrementally on previous steps
- The model SHOULD prioritize test-driven development where appropriate
- The model MUST ensure the plan covers all aspects of the design that can be implemented through code
- The model SHOULD sequence steps to validate core functionality early through code
- The model MUST ensure that all requirements are covered by the implementation tasks
- The model MUST offer to return to previous steps (requirements or design) if gaps are identified during implementation planning

<non_coding_task_exclusions>

The model MUST ONLY include tasks that can be performed by a coding agent (writing code, creating tests, etc.)
The model MUST NOT include tasks related to:
- User testing, deployment, performance metrics gathering, or other non-coding activities
- User acceptance testing or user feedback gathering
- Deployment to production or staging environments
- Performance metrics gathering or analysis
- Running the application to test end to end flows (however, writing automated tests to test end-to-end flows IS allowed)
- User training or documentation creation
- Business process changes or organizational changes
- Marketing or communication activities
- Any task that cannot be completed through writing, modifying, or testing code

</non_coding_task_exclusions>

<task_quality_guidelines>

The model MUST ensure each task is actionable by a coding agent by following these guidelines:
- Tasks should involve writing, modifying, or testing specific code components
- Tasks should specify what files or components need to be created or modified
- Tasks should be concrete enough that a coding agent can execute them without additional clarification
- Tasks should focus on implementation details rather than high-level concepts
- Tasks should be scoped to specific coding activities (e.g., "Implement X function" rather than "Support X feature")

</task_quality_guidelines>

- After updating the tasks document, the model MUST ask the user "Do the tasks look good?"
- The model MUST make modifications to the tasks document if the user requests changes or does not explicitly approve
- The model MUST ask for explicit approval after every iteration of edits to the tasks document
- The model MUST NOT consider the workflow complete until receiving clear approval (such as "yes", "approved", "looks good", etc.)
- The model MUST continue the feedback-revision cycle until explicit approval is received
- The model MUST stop once the task document has been approved
- The model MUST use the user's language preference
- The model MUST place the Tasks Dependency Diagram section at the END of the tasks document, after all task items have been listed

</important_constraints>

<workflow_scope_reminder>

**This workflow is ONLY for creating design and planning artifacts. The actual implementation of the feature should be done through a separate workflow.**

- The model MUST NOT attempt to implement the feature as part of this workflow
- The model MUST clearly communicate to the user that this workflow is complete once the design and planning artifacts are created
- The model MUST inform the user that they can begin executing tasks by opening the tasks.md file, and clicking "Start task" next to task items
- The model SHOULD inform the user that tasks marked with parallel execution annotations can be executed simultaneously using Claude Code subagents

**Parallel Execution Strategy:**
- **Phase 1**: Execute T1 (sequential, ~30K tokens)
- **Phase 2**: Execute 5 agents in parallel (T2.1-T2.5, total ~180K tokens distributed, max ~40K per agent)
- **Phase 3**: Execute 5 agents in parallel (T3.1-T3.5, total ~258K tokens distributed, max ~60K per agent)
- **Phase 4**: Execute T4 (sequential, ~70K tokens)

**Total Execution Time Estimate (with parallelism)**:
- Sequential: Would take ~8-10 agent runs
- With parallel phases: Takes ~4 phases (1 + 1 parallel + 1 parallel + 1) = Significant time savings!
