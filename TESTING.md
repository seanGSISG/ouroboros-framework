2. Verify workflow orchestrator is invoked
3. Verify it reads:
   - `ouroboros/specs/test-feature/requirements.md`
   - `ouroboros/specs/test-feature/design.md`
   - `ouroboros/specs/test-feature/tasks.md`
4. Verify it calls appropriate agents:
   - `spec-requirements` for requirements (if needed)
   - `spec-design` for design (if needed)
   - `spec-tasks` for task planning (if needed)
   - `spec-impl` for implementation
5. Verify phase execution works
6. Verify summaries are saved to:
   - `ouroboros/specs/test-feature/phases/phase-X/summary-X.Y.md`

### Test 4: Auto-Generated Skills

**Objective**: Verify skill file is auto-generated during execution

**Steps**:
1. After Phase 1 of workflow execution
2. Verify skill file created:
   - `.claude/skills/test-feature.md` (in PROJECT root, not ouroboros/.claude/)
3. Verify skill contains:
   - Project context
   - Key decisions
   - Terminology
   - Patterns
4. Verify subsequent tasks reference the skill

### Test 5: Phase Consolidation

**Objective**: Verify phase consolidation works after parallel tasks

**Steps**:
1. Execute a phase with parallel tasks
2. Verify each task agent saves summary:
   - `ouroboros/specs/test-feature/phases/phase-2/summary-2.1.md`
   - `ouroboros/specs/test-feature/phases/phase-2/summary-2.2.md`
   - etc.
3. Verify orchestrator consolidates summaries:
   - `ouroboros/specs/test-feature/phases/phase-2/consolidated.md`
4. Verify consolidation includes:
   - Discoveries from all tasks
   - Recommendations for task updates
   - Metrics (context usage, time)
5. Verify orchestrator prompts user to approve task updates

**Expected Result**: Consolidation works, task updates offered

**Status**: ⏸️ Ready to test

---

### Test 6: Adaptive Tasks

**Objective**: Verify tasks can be updated based on discoveries

**Steps**:
1. During consolidation, approve task updates
2. Verify `spec-tasks` agent is called to update tasks
3. Verify new version created:
   - `ouroboros/specs/test-feature/tasks.md` → `tasks-v2.md`
4. Verify changes are reflected in new version
5. Verify original preserved

**Expected Result**: Tasks updated with versioning

**Status**: ⏸️ Ready to test

---

### Test 7: Archive Spec

**Objective**: Verify `/archive-spec` command works

**Steps**:
1. Mark all tasks complete in `tasks.md`
2. Run `/archive-spec test-feature`
3. Verify confirmation shows 100% complete
4. Verify spec moved to:
   - `ouroboros/specs/archive/test-feature/`
5. Verify ARCHIVED.md created with metadata
6. Verify prompt to remove skill file
7. If yes, verify `.claude/skills/test-feature.md` removed

**Expected Result**: Spec archived successfully

**Status**: ⏸️ Ready to test

---

### Test 8: Update Managed Blocks

**Objective**: Verify `/ouroboros-update` command works

**Steps**:
1. Create a test CLAUDE.md with managed block:
   ```markdown
   <!-- OUROBOROS:START -->
   Old content
   <!-- OUROBOROS:END -->
   ```
2. Run `/ouroboros-update`
3. Verify managed block updated with latest instructions
4. Verify content outside block preserved

**Expected Result**: Managed block updated correctly

**Status**: ⏸️ Ready to test

---

### Test 9: Pattern Template Selection

**Objective**: Verify pattern templates work for all 5 patterns

**Steps**:
For each pattern (Structured Sequential, Creative Iterative, Resource Management, Exploratory Research, Modern Dev Workflow):
1. Run `/new-spec {pattern-name}-test`
2. Select the pattern
3. Verify correct template files copied
4. Verify templates match pattern characteristics

## Integration Points

### Agents ↔ Workflow Orchestrator

**How they connect**:
- Workflow orchestrator calls agents using Task tool
- Agents receive feature name and parameters
- Agents read from `ouroboros/specs/{feature-name}/`
- Agents write to `ouroboros/specs/{feature-name}/`
- Agents save summaries to `ouroboros/specs/{feature-name}/phases/`

**Verified**: ✅ Path references correct in all components

---

### Commands ↔ Specs

**How they connect**:
- `/new-spec` creates spec structure in `ouroboros/specs/`
- `/list-specs` reads from `ouroboros/specs/`
- `/archive-spec` moves specs to `ouroboros/specs/archive/`
- All commands use correct paths

**Verified**: ✅ Commands reference correct locations

---

### Workflow ↔ Templates

**How they connect**:
- `/new-spec` copies from `ouroboros/ouroboros/templates/patterns/`
- `spec-impl` reads templates from `ouroboros/ouroboros/templates/`
- Workflow uses consolidation template from `ouroboros/ouroboros/templates/`

**Verified**: ✅ Template paths updated correctly

---

### Workflow ↔ Intelligence

**How they connect**:
- Pattern recognizer detects pattern from requirements
- Skills generator creates `.claude/skills/{feature-name}.md`
- Learning engine captures metrics during execution
- Template selector chooses appropriate pattern template

**Verified**: ✅ Intelligence components paths correct

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issue 1: OpenSpec Agents Location

**Issue**: Core agents still in `open-spec/agents/kfc/` (not in `ouroboros/.claude/agents/`)

**Reason**: These are legacy agents that were enhanced, not replaced. Moving them would break existing OpenSpec workflows.

**Impact**: None - agents work correctly from their current location

**Resolution**: Documented in ARCHITECTURE.md as intentional design

---

### Issue 2: Auto-Generated Skills Location

**Issue**: Skills generated to project root `.claude/skills/`, not `ouroboros/.claude/skills/`

**Reason**: Claude Code discovers skills in project root `.claude/skills/` directory

**Impact**: None - this is correct behavior

**Resolution**: Documented in ARCHITECTURE.md as intentional design

---

## Success Criteria

Ouroboros is fully functional when:

- ✅ All 4 commands work correctly
- ✅ All 8 agents accessible and have correct paths
- ✅ Workflow orchestrator executes specs end-to-end
- ✅ Templates used correctly for all 5 patterns
- ✅ Auto-generated skills created and used
- ✅ Phase consolidation and adaptive tasks work
- ✅ Archival system preserves completed specs
- ✅ Works for all project types (code, docs, planning, scripts, creative)

**Current Status**: ✅ All components in place, ready for integration testing

ls -la ouroboros/.claude/
ls -la ouroboros/ouroboros/

# 2. Count components
find ouroboros/.claude/commands -name "*.md" | wc -l  # Should be 4
find ouroboros/.claude/agents -name "*.md" | wc -l    # Should be 1
find open-spec/agents/kfc -name "*.md" | wc -l        # Should be 8

# 3. Verify paths
grep -r "\.claude/specs/" ouroboros/.claude/          # Should find 0 (except docs)
grep -r "ouroboros/specs/" ouroboros/.claude/         # Should find many

# 4. Check templates
ls ouroboros/ouroboros/templates/patterns/*.md | wc -l  # Should be 17

# 5. Check examples
ls ouroboros/ouroboros/examples/*/                    # Should show vacation-planning-europe
```

**Expected output**: All checks pass ✅
