## Research Phases

### Phase 1: Broad Exploration (Breadth-First)

**Goal**: Cast wide net, identify landscape

**Data Collection**:
- Source 1: [What, how, why]
- Source 2: [What, how, why]
- Source 3: [What, how, why]

**Initial Analysis**: [How to process initial data]

**Deliverable**: Landscape map, initial patterns

---

### Phase 2: Pattern Recognition

**Goal**: Identify trends, themes, anomalies

**Analysis Methods**:
- [Method 1]: [Description]
- [Method 2]: [Description]

**Pattern Types to Look For**:
- Trends: [What trends]
- Outliers: [What anomalies]
- Correlations: [What relationships]

**Deliverable**: Pattern analysis report

---

### Phase 3: Deep Investigation

**Goal**: Investigate key findings in depth

**Focus Areas** (based on Phase 2):
- Area 1: [Why important, how to investigate]
- Area 2: [Why important, how to investigate]

**Deep Dive Methods**:
- [Method 1]: [Description]
- [Method 2]: [Description]

**Deliverable**: Detailed findings per focus area

---

### Phase 4: Synthesis & Recommendations

## Cross-Domain Examples

**Performance Investigation**: Profile app → Identify bottlenecks → Test fixes → Report optimizations

**Competitive Analysis**: Identify competitors → Feature comparison → Market positioning → Strategic insights

**Vendor Selection**: Requirements → Research vendors → Deep-dive top 3 → Recommendation

**Security Audit**: Vulnerability scan → Investigate findings → Exploit testing → Security report
