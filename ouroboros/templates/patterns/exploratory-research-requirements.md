  - AC 3.2.2: Additional research triggered as needed
  - AC 3.2.3: Scope expanded if justified

### 4. Deep Investigation

**4.1** WHEN patterns identified, the system SHALL investigate deeply
  - AC 4.1.1: Detailed analysis of key findings
  - AC 4.1.2: Root causes identified
  - AC 4.1.3: Implications understood
  - AC 4.1.4: Evidence collected and verified

### 5. Synthesis & Recommendations

**5.1** WHEN research complete, the system SHALL synthesize findings
  - AC 5.1.1: Key insights summarized
  - AC 5.1.2: Research questions answered
  - AC 5.1.3: Confidence levels stated
  - AC 5.1.4: Limitations acknowledged

**5.2** WHERE actionable, the system SHALL provide recommendations
  - AC 5.2.1: Recommendations prioritized
  - AC 5.2.2: Evidence-based rationale provided
  - AC 5.2.3: Next steps suggested
  - AC 5.2.4: Risks and trade-offs identified

## Cross-Domain Examples

**Code - Performance Investigation**: Profile → Analyze bottlenecks → Test hypotheses → Recommend optimizations

**Documentation - Competitive Analysis**: Identify competitors → Research features → Compare → Synthesize insights

**Planning - Vendor Selection**: Define requirements → Research options → Evaluate → Recommend vendor

**Scripts - Security Audit**: Scan → Investigate findings → Test vulnerabilities → Report recommendations

**Creative - Market Research**: Identify trends → Gather data → Analyze patterns → Strategic recommendations

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Research questions answered
- [ ] Findings synthesized and documented
- [ ] Recommendations actionable
- [ ] Evidence credible and sufficient
- [ ] Scope complete (or rationale for expansion)
