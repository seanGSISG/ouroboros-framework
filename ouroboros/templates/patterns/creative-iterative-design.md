### 4.2 Implement Changes
- Address high-priority feedback first
- Make medium-priority changes where feasible
- Document decisions on low-priority items
- Preserve what works well

### 4.3 Quality Check
- Self-review against criteria
- Compare to previous iteration
- Verify improvements made
- Identify remaining gaps

### 4.4 Version Control
- Document what changed
- Maintain version history
- Track quality trend
- Prepare for next feedback round

**Iteration Metrics**:
- Changes implemented: [Count]
- Quality score change: [Previous → Current]
- Remaining gaps: [Count]
- Convergence assessment: [Approaching/Stable/Diverging]

**Stopping Criteria** (When to move to finalization):
- [ ] Quality threshold met: [Specific criteria]
- [ ] All critical feedback addressed
- [ ] Stakeholder approval received
- [ ] Diminishing returns on iterations

**Max Iteration Safeguard**:
- Max iterations: [N]
- If reached without convergence: [Escalation plan]
