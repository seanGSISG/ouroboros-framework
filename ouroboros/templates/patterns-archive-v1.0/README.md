# Pattern Templates - Archived v1.0

**Status**: DEPRECATED - Archived on 2025-10-26
**Reason**: Replaced by Dynamic Template Generation v2.0
**Issue**: DISC-001 - Templates contained tech-specific jargon

## Why These Were Archived

These static templates violated Ouroboros's core principle of being "tech-stack and project agnostic."

**Problems**:
- Hardcoded Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD terminology
- Unusable for non-software projects
- Required 30+ minutes of manual customization

**Replacement**: Dynamic Template Generation v2.0
See: ouroboros/specs/dynamic-template-generation/

**Do Not Use These Templates For New Projects**
Use /ou-new-spec with dynamic generation v2.0 instead.
