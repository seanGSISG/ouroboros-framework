# Requirements - Ouroboros Meta Test

**Pattern**: Modern Development Workflow

**Pattern Characteristics**:
- Automation-first approach
- Version controlled
- Infrastructure as code
- Observable and monitored
- API-driven
- Containerized/reproducible

---

## Project Overview

**What are we building/automating?**
A comprehensive meta-test of the Ouroboros framework itself, validating that all workflows, commands, agents, and patterns work as documented. This test serves as both quality validation and living documentation.

**Why automation-first?**
To ensure the framework can dogfood itself—if Ouroboros cannot manage its own testing and validation using Ouroboros specs, it's not truly tech-stack agnostic or self-improving.

**Target deployment environment**:
Local development environment (Claude Code CLI), testing the framework's ability to manage complex, recursive workflows.

## Requirements (EARS Format)

### 1. Core Functionality

**1.1** WHEN implementing core features, the system SHALL follow cloud-native principles
  - AC 1.1.1: Stateless where possible
  - AC 1.1.2: 12-factor app methodology
  - AC 1.1.3: Configuration externalized
  - AC 1.1.4: Secrets managed securely

**1.2** WHERE APIs are exposed, the system SHALL be API-first
  - AC 1.2.1: OpenAPI/Swagger spec generated
  - AC 1.2.2: API versioning strategy defined
  - AC 1.2.3: RESTful or GraphQL standards followed

### 2. Automation & CI/CD

**2.1** WHEN code changes, the system SHALL trigger automated pipeline
  - AC 2.1.1: Automated testing (unit, integration, e2e)
  - AC 2.1.2: Automated builds
  - AC 2.1.3: Automated deployment to staging
  - AC 2.1.4: Manual approval gate for production

**2.2** IF tests fail, the system SHALL prevent deployment
  - AC 2.2.1: Pipeline fails fast
  - AC 2.2.2: Clear failure messages
  - AC 2.2.3: Notifications sent to team

**2.3** WHERE quality gates exist, the system SHALL enforce them
  - AC 2.3.1: Code coverage threshold (e.g., >80%)
  - AC 2.3.2: Linting standards enforced
  - AC 2.3.3: Security scanning passed
  - AC 2.3.4: Performance benchmarks met

### 3. Infrastructure as Code

**3.1** WHEN provisioning infrastructure, the system SHALL use IaC
  - AC 3.1.1: Infrastructure defined in code (Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.)
  - AC 3.1.2: Version controlled
  - AC 3.1.3: Reproducible environments
  - AC 3.1.4: Environment parity (dev = staging = prod config-wise)

**3.2** IF infrastructure changes, the system SHALL apply changes safely
  - AC 3.2.1: Plan before apply
  - AC 3.2.2: State management handled
  - AC 3.2.3: Rollback capability

### 4. Containerization & Orchestration

**4.1** WHERE applications are deployed, the system SHALL use containers
  - AC 4.1.1: Dockerfiles defined
  - AC 4.1.2: Images optimized (multi-stage builds, minimal base)
  - AC 4.1.3: Images scanned for vulnerabilities
  - AC 4.1.4: Images versioned and tagged

**4.2** IF orchestration needed, the system SHALL use Kubernetes or equivalent
  - AC 4.2.1: Deployment manifests defined
  - AC 4.2.2: Resource limits configured
  - AC 4.2.3: Health checks configured
  - AC 4.2.4: Horizontal pod autoscaling configured

### 5. Observability & Monitoring

**5.1** WHEN application runs, the system SHALL emit telemetry
  - AC 5.1.1: Structured logging (JSON, correlation IDs)
  - AC 5.1.2: Metrics exposed (Prometheus format or equivalent)
  - AC 5.1.3: Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry or equivalent)
  - AC 5.1.4: Health endpoints (/health, /ready, /metrics)

**5.2** WHERE monitoring is configured, the system SHALL alert on issues
  - AC 5.2.1: Error rate alerts
  - AC 5.2.2: Latency alerts
  - AC 5.2.3: Resource utilization alerts
  - AC 5.2.4: Availability alerts

**5.3** IF incidents occur, the system SHALL facilitate debugging
  - AC 5.3.1: Logs aggregated and searchable
  - AC 5.3.2: Traces correlate across services
  - AC 5.3.3: Metrics visualized in dashboards
  - AC 5.3.4: Runbooks documented

### 6. Security & Compliance

**6.1** WHEN deploying, the system SHALL follow security best practices
  - AC 6.1.1: Principle of least privilege
  - AC 6.1.2: Secrets encrypted at rest and in transit
  - AC 6.1.3: Dependencies scanned for vulnerabilities
  - AC 6.1.4: Security patches automated where safe

**6.2** WHERE compliance required, the system SHALL enforce policies
  - AC 6.2.1: Audit logs retained per policy
  - AC 6.2.2: Data residency requirements met
  - AC 6.2.3: Encryption standards followed

### 7. GitOps & Version Control

**7.1** WHEN managing deployments, the system SHALL use GitOps principles
  - AC 7.1.1: Git as single source of truth
  - AC 7.1.2: Declarative desired state
  - AC 7.1.3: Automated reconciliation
  - AC 7.1.4: Pull-based deployment (optional)

**7.2** WHERE configuration changes, the system SHALL version control them
  - AC 7.2.1: All config in Git
  - AC 7.2.2: Environment-specific config separated
  - AC 7.2.3: Config changes reviewed via PR
  - AC 7.2.4: Rollback via Git revert

## Cross-Domain Examples

**Code - Microservice**: API → Containerize → CI/CD → Deploy K8s → Monitor

**Documentation - Doc-as-Code**: Write markdown → Version control → Auto-build → Deploy → Analytics

**Planning - Workflow Automation**: Define process → Code workflow → Test → Deploy → Measure

**Scripts - GitOps Infrastructure**: Define infra → Version control → Auto-apply → Observe

**Creative - Design System**: Components → Version → Publish → Consume → Track usage

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Fully automated CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Infrastructure reproducible via IaC
- [ ] Containerized and orchestrated
- [ ] Observable (logs, metrics, traces)
- [ ] Secure and compliant
- [ ] GitOps workflow functional
