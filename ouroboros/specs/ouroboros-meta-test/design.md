# Design - Ouroboros Meta Test

**Pattern**: Modern Development Workflow

**Design Philosophy**: Foundation → Automation → Deployment → Observability

---

## Architecture Overview

**Application Architecture**: Self-testing framework for validating Ouroboros workflows, agents, commands, and patterns

**Deployment Target**: Local Claude Code CLI environment with Ouroboros framework installed

**Automation Strategy**: Dogfooding approach—use Ouroboros specs to test Ouroboros itself, validating that the framework can manage its own quality assurance

---

## Phase 1 Design: Foundation

**Core Functionality**:
- **Test Spec Repository**: Create representative test specs across all 5 patterns (Structured Sequential, Creative Iterative, Resource Management, Exploratory Research, Modern Dev Workflow)
- **Component Inventory**: Catalog all testable components (slash commands, agents, pattern templates, workflows)
- **Test Harness**: Framework for executing tests and capturing results

**API Design**:
- Not applicable (testing framework internals, not exposing APIs)

**Data Layer**:
- **Storage**: Markdown test specs in `ouroboros/specs/ouroboros-meta-test/test-cases/`
- **Schema**: Each test case follows standard Ouroboros spec structure
- **Results**: Test results stored as phase summaries and consolidated reports

---

## Phase 2 Design: Automation

**Testing Pipeline**:
```
Identify Test Scope
  ↓
Create Test Specs (1 per pattern)
  ↓
Execute Slash Commands (/ou-new-spec, /ou-expand-spec, /ou:proposal, /ou:apply, /ou:archive)
  ↓
Validate Agent Behavior (spec-requirements, spec-design, spec-tasks, spec-impl, spec-test, spec-validator)
  ↓
Test Pattern Detection & Adaptation
  ↓
Verify Context Efficiency (token usage, skill generation)
  ↓
Validate Discovery & Adaptation Loop
  ↓
Generate Test Report
```

**Testing Strategy**:
- **Unit**: Test individual components (each slash command, each agent type)
- **Integration**: Test full workflows (new-spec → expand-spec → execute → validate)
- **E2E**: Test complete feature lifecycle using Ouroboros to manage itself
- **Meta**: Validate that discoveries from tests feed back into improved specs (the Ouroboros loop)

**Quality Gates**:
- All 5 pattern templates successfully create and execute specs
- All slash commands execute without errors
- All agents produce expected outputs
- Token usage stays within estimated budgets
- UX issues documented (e.g., "CRUD question is confusing")

---

## Phase 3 Design: Test Execution

**Test Cases**:

1. **Pattern: Structured Sequential Workflow**
   - Test case: "Create documentation for Ouroboros CLI"
   - Validates: Sequential phases, validation gates, structured output

2. **Pattern: Creative Iterative Process**
   - Test case: "Design new Ouroboros logo concept"
   - Validates: Feedback loops, iteration cycles, subjective quality assessment

3. **Pattern: Resource Management**
   - Test case: "Build test spec CRUD API"
   - Validates: CRUD operations, state tracking, validation rules

4. **Pattern: Exploratory Research**
   - Test case: "Investigate token optimization strategies"
   - Validates: Discovery-driven workflow, hypothesis testing, unknown scope

5. **Pattern: Modern Dev Workflow**
   - Test case: "This meta-test itself"
   - Validates: Automation, CI/CD concepts, observability

**Execution Strategy**:
- Run tests sequentially (avoid conflicts)
- Capture all intermediate outputs
- Measure context token usage per phase
- Validate adaptive task updates occur
- Ensure auto-generated skills are created

---

## Phase 4 Design: Observability

**Test Results Tracking**:
- **Format**: Markdown test reports with pass/fail status
- **Metrics**: Token usage, execution time, success rate per component
- **Discoveries**: UX issues, bugs, improvement opportunities
- **Validation**: Screenshots/examples of successful executions

**Key Metrics**:
- **Coverage**: % of components tested (slash commands, agents, patterns)
- **Success Rate**: % of tests passing
- **Token Efficiency**: Actual vs estimated token usage
- **Adaptation Rate**: % of phases that triggered task updates

**Test Report Structure**:
```markdown
# Ouroboros Meta Test Report

## Executive Summary
- Total tests: X
- Passed: Y
- Failed: Z
- Coverage: W%

## Test Results by Component
### Slash Commands
- /ou-new-spec: ✅ PASS
- /ou-expand-spec: ✅ PASS
...

### Agents
- spec-requirements: ✅ PASS
- spec-design: ⚠️ PARTIAL (note: issue found)
...

### Patterns
- Structured Sequential: ✅ PASS
...

## Discoveries & Improvements
- UX Issue: CRUD question confusing → Recommend simplification
- Bug: [Description]
- Enhancement: [Suggestion]

## Token Analysis
- Estimated: Xk tokens
- Actual: Yk tokens
- Variance: Z%

## Recommendations
[List of improvements to make to Ouroboros based on test findings]

## Security Design

**Not applicable** (testing framework has no security requirements beyond file system access)

## GitOps Design

**Git Structure**:
```

```

**Testing Flow**:
1. Create ouroboros-meta-test spec (✅ complete—we're doing it now!)
2. Execute test creation phase
3. Execute test validation phase
4. Generate consolidated test report
5. Feed discoveries back into Ouroboros improvements
6. The serpent eats its tail and grows stronger 🐍

## Disaster Recovery

**Not applicable** (tests can be re-run, no critical data at risk)

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 5 pattern templates validated
- [ ] All slash commands tested and working
- [ ] All agents tested and producing correct outputs
- [ ] Token usage within acceptable variance (±20% of estimates)
- [ ] At least 3 UX improvements discovered and documented
- [ ] Test report generated and comprehensive
- [ ] Proof that Ouroboros can dogfood itself successfully
