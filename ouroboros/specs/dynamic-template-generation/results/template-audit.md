# Ouroboros Pattern Template Audit Report

**Audit Date**: 2025-10-26
**Auditor**: Dynamic Template Generation Project
**Purpose**: Identify tech-specific jargon violations in pattern templates

---

## Executive Summary

**Total Templates Audited**: 15 files across 5 patterns
**Patterns**: Modern Dev Workflow, Resource Management, Structured Sequential, Creative Iterative, Exploratory Research

**Key Findings**:
- ‚ùå **Modern Dev Workflow**: SEVERE violations (35+ tech-specific terms)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Resource Management**: MODERATE violations (15+ tech terms, including "CRUD")
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Structured Sequential**: MINOR violations (mostly in examples)
- ‚úÖ **Creative Iterative**: ACCEPTABLE (mostly domain-agnostic)
- ‚úÖ **Exploratory Research**: EXCELLENT (highly generic)

**Conclusion**: 2 of 5 patterns violate the "tech-stack agnostic" principle. Templates provide negative value for non-software projects.

## Pattern-by-Pattern Analysis

### 1. Modern Development Workflow ‚ùå CRITICAL

**Violation Severity**: CRITICAL
**Tech-Agnostic Score**: 15/100 (FAIL)

**Tech-Specific Terms Found** (`modern-dev-workflow-*.md`):

#### In Requirements (`requirements.md`):
- Line 10: "API-driven"
- Line 18: "microservices"
- Line 38-41: "APIs", "OpenAPI/Swagger", "API versioning", "RESTful", "GraphQL"
- Line 43: "CI/CD"
- Line 64: "Infrastructure as Code", "IaC"
- Line 78: "Dockerfiles"
- Line 83: "Kubernetes"
- Line 124: "GitOps"
- Line 140: "Containerize", "Deploy K8s"

#### In Design (`design.md`):
- "Microservices, Monolith, Serverless"
- "Kubernetes, Cloud Functions, VMs"
- "CI/CD tool"
- "Docker image"
- "K8s network policies"
- "Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi"

#### In Tasks (`tasks.md`):
- Line 15: "Implement core API/functionality"
- Line 16: "data layer and schema"
- Line 24: "CI/CD pipeline"
- Line 25: "GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins"
- Line 42: "Docker multi-stage build"
- Line 51: "Infrastructure as Code (IaC)"
- Line 52: "Terraform"
- Line 58: "K8s manifests"
- Line 64: "GitOps"
- Line 75: "JSON logging"
- Line 81: "/metrics endpoint"
- Line 83: "Grafana, CloudWatch"
- Line 88: "OpenTelemetry"

**Total Tech Terms**: 35+ identified

**Problem Examples**:
```markdown
# From tasks.md
### Phase 2: Automation (4 parallel üêç)

- [ ] **üêç 2.1 Setup CI/CD pipeline**
  - Configure CI tool (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins)

- [ ] **üêç 2.4 Create build automation**
  - Docker multi-stage build
  - Optimize image size
```

**Why This Fails**:
If a user selects "Modern Dev Workflow" for:
- Meta-testing project ‚Üí Gets Docker/K8s (irrelevant)
- Vacation planning ‚Üí Gets CI/CD pipelines (nonsense)
- Documentation project ‚Üí Gets Kubernetes (confusing)

**Impact**: Template must be 95% rewritten for non-DevOps projects

---

### 2. Resource Management ‚ö†Ô∏è MODERATE

**Violation Severity**: MODERATE
**Tech-Agnostic Score**: 45/100 (MARGINAL)

**Tech-Specific Terms Found**:

#### In Requirements (`requirements.md`):
- Line 6: "CRUD operations" (Create, Read, Update, Delete) ‚Üê **USER COMPLAINT**
- "Database", "Schema", "API endpoints"
- "REST API", "GraphQL"
- "Infrastructure", "Provider setup"

#### In Design (`design.md`):
- Line 5: "CRUD operations"
- Line 19: "CRUD Operation Design"
- Line 110: "REST API", "JWT auth"

#### In Tasks (`tasks.md`):
- Line 5: "CRUD operations"
- Line 13: "data storage and schema"
- Line 16: "Phase 2: CRUD Operations"
- Line 39: "Schema ‚Üí Article CRUD"
- Line 41: "Infrastructure: Provider setup ‚Üí Resource CRUD"

**Total Tech Terms**: 15+ identified

**The CRUD Problem** (User's Specific Complaint):
```markdown
# From resource-management-requirements.md, line 6:
**Pattern Characteristics**:
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
```

User feedback:
> "i dont know what CRUD is, you should add to our notes that this question is bad and not user friendly"

**Why This Fails**:
- CRUD is software development jargon
- Not understood by non-technical users
- Used in `/ou-new-spec` question without explanation
- Prevents non-technical users from using Resource Management pattern

**Better Alternative**: "Does this involve managing information (creating, viewing, editing, deleting)?"

**Impact**: Confuses non-technical users, blocks access to pattern

---

### 3. Structured Sequential Workflow ‚ö†Ô∏è MINOR

**Violation Severity**: MINOR (mostly in examples)
**Tech-Agnostic Score**: 75/100 (ACCEPTABLE with caveats)

**Tech-Specific Terms Found**:

#### In Template Body:
- Mostly placeholders: `[Stage 1 Name]`, `[Task name]`, etc. ‚úÖ Good!

#### In Examples (Lines 246-342):
- Line 260: "database loader"
- Line 278: "API reference"
- Line 289: "Generate documentation site"
- Line 326: "Deployment"

**Why This is Better**:
- Main template body uses generic placeholders
- Tech terms confined to examples section
- Examples show diversity (Code, Documentation, Planning, Scripts)

**Remaining Issue**:
- Examples still lean toward software development
- Could add more non-tech examples (wedding planning, book writing, etc.)

**Impact**: Minor - examples can be ignored, main template is usable

---

### 4. Creative Iterative Process ‚úÖ ACCEPTABLE

**Violation Severity**: MINIMAL
**Tech-Agnostic Score**: 85/100 (GOOD)

**Tech-Specific Terms Found**:

#### In Template Body:
- Mostly generic: "stakeholders", "feedback", "iteration", "alternatives" ‚úÖ
- Good use of domain-agnostic language

#### In Examples (Lines 369-451):
- Line 370: "UI/UX Design"
- Line 391: "Design system"
- Line 392: "Developer handoff"

**Why This Works**:
- Template body is highly generic
- Process-focused, not tech-focused
- Examples include non-tech domains (blog post, vacation itinerary)

**Strength**:
- Line 426-451: Vacation planning example is excellent!
- Shows pattern works for non-tech projects

**Impact**: Minimal - template is largely usable across domains

---

### 5. Exploratory Research ‚úÖ EXCELLENT

**Violation Severity**: MINIMAL
**Tech-Agnostic Score**: 95/100 (EXCELLENT)

**Tech-Specific Terms Found**:

#### In Template Body:
- Completely generic! "Data source exploration", "patterns", "findings" ‚úÖ

#### In Examples (Lines 49-71):
- Line 50: "Profile app", "check configs"
- Line 62: "tech stack"

**Why This Excels**:
- Template body has ZERO tech jargon
- Process is truly universal
- Examples show diversity (performance, competitive analysis, vendor selection)

**Strength**:
- Lines 58-63: Competitive analysis example works for any domain
- Lines 65-71: Vendor selection is business-focused

**Impact**: None - template is universally applicable

---

## Content Type Categorization

### Structural Content (Pattern-Agnostic) ‚úÖ
**What it is**: Phase structure, task format, parallelization markers
**Examples**:
- "Phase 1: Foundation (Sequential üêå)"
- "- [ ] **üêç 2.1 Task name**"
- "Can run in parallel with 2.2, 2.3"

**Status**: GOOD - This should be preserved in dynamic generation

### Pattern-Specific Content (Domain-Agnostic) ‚úÖ
**What it is**: Pattern logic without tech terms
**Examples**:
- "Iteration Cycle (Repeatable)"
- "Feedback & Selection"
- "Broad Exploration ‚Üí Analysis ‚Üí Deep Investigation"

**Status**: GOOD - Pattern characteristics, usable across domains

### Domain-Specific Content (Tech-Agnostic) ‚ö†Ô∏è
**What it is**: Domain terminology (code, docs, planning) without jargon
**Examples**:
- "Create outline" (documentation)
- "Book venue" (planning)
- "Gather inspiration" (creative)

**Status**: ACCEPTABLE - Shows flexibility, should be generated dynamically per domain

### Tech-Specific Content (Violations) ‚ùå
**What it is**: Software/DevOps terminology that's irrelevant to other domains
**Examples**:
- "Docker", "Kubernetes", "CI/CD"
- "API", "database", "schema" (when not in software domain)
- "CRUD", "REST", "microservices"

**Status**: UNACCEPTABLE - Must be removed or made conditional on domain=software

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Critical)
1. **Replace Modern Dev Workflow template** with minimal placeholders
2. **Fix CRUD terminology** in Resource Management pattern
3. **Add jargon detection** to prevent future violations

### Short-Term (High Priority)
1. **Create structural templates** (phase format only, zero content)
2. **Implement dynamic generation** to fill placeholders based on domain
3. **Add domain-specific examples** (not just software)

### Long-Term (Enhancement)
1. **Validate all generated specs** against jargon rules
2. **Expand cross-domain examples** in all patterns
3. **User test with non-technical users** (planners, writers, designers)

---

## Success Metrics

**Current State**:
- 2/5 patterns (40%) have critical/moderate violations
- 45+ tech-specific terms in worst pattern
- User complaint filed about "CRUD" terminology

**Target State**:
- 0/5 patterns with violations (outside software domain)
- 0 tech-specific terms in non-software specs
- Non-technical users can create specs without confusion

**Validation**:
- Re-run ouroboros-meta-test ‚Üí Should generate testing-appropriate tasks (NOT Docker/K8s)
- Create vacation-planning spec ‚Üí Should get "book flights", NOT "setup CI/CD"
- Create blog-post spec ‚Üí Should get "write outline", NOT "deploy K8s"

---

## Conclusion

The audit confirms **DISC-001** (from ouroboros-meta-test):

> Pattern templates are NOT tech-stack agnostic as claimed. They contain extensive software development jargon that makes them unusable for non-technical projects without 95% manual rewriting.

**Root Cause**: Templates were written for software development use cases and never generalized.

**Solution**: Implement dynamic template generation (Phase 2 of this spec).
