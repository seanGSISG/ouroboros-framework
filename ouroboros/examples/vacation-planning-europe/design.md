# Design: Europe Summer Vacation 2024

**Pattern Detected**: Creative Iterative Process
**Approach**: Multiple research-plan-refine cycles with flexibility for discoveries

---

## 1. Design Approach (Pattern-Based)

### Creative Iterative Strategy

Based on the **Creative Iterative Process** pattern, this plan uses:

1. **Broad Research Phase**: Explore multiple destination options
2. **Draft Itinerary**: Create initial 14-day plan
3. **Price Discovery**: Research actual costs
4. **Refinement Cycles**: Adjust based on availability and budget
5. **Booking Phase**: Lock in reservations
6. **Final Polish**: Add details, contingencies, documentation

### Iteration Triggers

Revisions will be triggered by:
- Price changes (flights, hotels)
- Availability constraints (sold out accommodations)
- Discovery of better alternatives
- Budget overruns
- Seasonal considerations (festivals, weather)

---

## 2. Destination Design

### Proposed Route: France → Switzerland → Italy

**Rationale**:
- Geographic logic (minimal backtracking)
- Diverse experiences (Paris culture, Swiss Alps nature, Italian history)
- Excellent train connectivity
- June weather ideal for all three

### City Selection

**France (5 days)**:
- Paris (3 days): Museums, food, architecture
- Lyon (2 days): Culinary capital, Roman ruins

**Switzerland (4 days)**:
- Interlaken (2 days): Alps, outdoor activities
- Lucerne (2 days): Medieval town, Lake Lucerne

**Italy (5 days)**:
- Venice (2 days): Canals, art, unique city
- Florence (2 days): Renaissance art, Tuscany
- Rome (1 day): Ancient history (flexible, may extend)

### Alternative Routes (Iteration Options)

If budget/availability issues:
- **Route B**: Skip Switzerland, add more Italy (less expensive)
- **Route C**: France → Germany → Austria (different cultural mix)
- **Route D**: Focus on 2 countries only (deeper vs. broader)

---

## 3. Transportation Architecture

### Flight Strategy

**Primary Option**:
- Outbound: NYC → Paris (Charles de Gaulle)
- Return: Rome (Fiumicino) → NYC
- Open-jaw ticket (saves backtracking)

**Booking Strategy**:
- Search 6-8 weeks before departure
- Compare: Google Flights, Skyscanner, airline direct
- Flexibility: ±2 days on dates if significant savings

### Inter-City Rail Network

```
Paris → Lyon (TGV, 2hrs)
Lyon → Geneva → Interlaken (regional + scenic, 5hrs)
Interlaken → Lucerne (Golden Pass, 2hrs)
Lucerne → Milan → Venice (EuroCity, 5hrs)
Venice → Florence (Frecciarossa, 2hrs)
Florence → Rome (Frecciarossa, 1.5hrs)
```

**Rail Passes Considered**:
- Eurail Global Pass (15 days, 1st class): ~$600
- vs. Point-to-point tickets: Calculate and compare
- Swiss Travel Pass (4 days): ~$280 (covers all Swiss transport)

## 4. Accommodation Strategy

### Booking Platform Mix

- **Paris/Rome**: Booking.com (hotels, free cancellation)
- **Lyon/Florence**: Airbnb (local apartments)
