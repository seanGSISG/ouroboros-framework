**Phase 2 Summary**: 4 agents × avg 20 min = **~22 minutes** (longest task: 2.3)

**Phase 2 Discoveries** (Example - from consolidated.md):
```
✅ Completed all research tasks

🔍 Key Discoveries:
- Early morning flights to Paris save $400 vs afternoon flights
- Swiss hotels require 3-night minimum in June (peak season)
- Venice hotel prices 2x higher than expected ($220/night)

## Adaptive Task System in Action

### Example: Phase 2 → Phase 3 Adaptation

**Before Phase 2** (Original Plan):
- Switzerland: 4 nights
- Venice: 2 nights
- Flight: Any time of day

**After Phase 2** (Discoveries):
- Early morning flights save $400
- Swiss hotels need 3-night minimum (actually 5 nights safer)
- Venice expensive and crowded

**Task Updates Approved**:
- ✅ Task 3.1: Specify morning flights
- ✅ Task 3.2: Switzerland 4→5 nights, Venice 2→1 night
- ✅ Task 3.3: Swiss pass from 4 to 5 days

**Result**: Better itinerary based on real-world discoveries! 🐍
